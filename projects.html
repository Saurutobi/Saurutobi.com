				<br>Over the years, I've worked on many different projects, this website included. I've built a pretty decent portfolio, and am constantly adding to it.
				<br>Below are the finished works from University, or from my free time. Some links expand to show you only a few projects, others link to another page
				<br>for a more comprehensive view.
				<br>Each project can be downloaded and placed inside the proper container through a link on the seperate page, or can be viewed a syntax-highlighted text on this site.
				<br>I went through the laborious effort to properly highlight each project correctly.
				<br>If you wish to use to code for your own projects, and plan on distributing it free of charge, I hereby give you the right to do so, provided you give me proper
				<br>acknowledgement in the code and program description.
				<br>If you wish to review all files without downloading each link seperatly and without full program description as this site give, click HERE(Link to rar of all projects).

				<br>University Projects:
				<br>
				<br>Assembly and Sparc Processor programming (Will expand)
				<br>(this one expands out)
				<br>project one(Link to new page)
				<br>	This is a typescript for the first project of my CS2230 class. The goal was to multiply 2 integers, add them to another set of 2 integers, and add them to
				<br>	another set of 2 integers in the form: X1*X2 + Y1*Y2 + Z1*Z2. This project contains 2 parts, the first in standard Assembly, the second doing the multiplication
				<br>	with hexadecimal encoding of the 32bit functions
				<br>project two(Link to new page)
				<br>	This is a typescript for the second project of my CS2230 class. We were to send 8 hexadecimal characters to a C method and an Assembly method, and utilize masking
				<br>	to extract the specified byte in hexadecimal form from the input.
				<br>project three(Link to new page)
				<br>	This is a typescript for the third project of my CS2230 class. There were 3 goals to be done in seperate methods:
				<br>		1. send input to CountBits which counts the number of 1s in the 8 character hexadecimal input
				<br>		2. a loop which finds the hexadecimal representation for the number just before the 'C' flag in NZVC is set
				<br>		3. a loop which finds the hexadecimal representation for the number just before the 'V' flag in NZVC is set
				<br>project four(Link to new page)
				<br>	This is a typescript for the fourth project of my CS2230 class. The goal was to input grades, and output a scaled histogram of said grades on an 80x80 display
				<br>project five(Link to new page)
				<br>	This is a typescript for the fourht project of my CS2230 class. The goal was to take a provided C program, compile it to Assembly, then remove as many lines as possible
				<br>	without losing effectiveness. The one with the least amount of lines received a snickers bar. 5 people of 60(including me) removed the full 14 possible lines.
