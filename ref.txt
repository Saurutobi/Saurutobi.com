			Over the years, I've worked on many different projects, this website included. I've built a pretty decent portfolio, and am constantly adding to it.
			Below are the finished works from University, or from my free time. Some links expand to show you only a few projects, others link to another page
			for a more comprehensive view.
			Each project can be downloaded and placed inside the proper container through a link on the seperate page, or can be viewed a syntax-highlighted text on this site.
			I went through the laborious effort to properly highlight each project correctly.
			If you wish to use to code for your own projects, and plan on distributing it free of charge, I hereby give you the right to do so, provided you give me proper
			acknowledgement in the code and program description.
			If you wish to review all files without downloading each link seperatly and without full program description as this site give, click HERE(Link to rar of all projects).
			
			University Projects:
			
			Assembly and Sparc Processor programming (Will expand)
				(this one expands out)
				project one(Link to new page)
					This is a typescript for the first project of my CS2230 class. The goal was to multiply 2 integers, add them to another set of 2 integers, and add them to
					another set of 2 integers in the form: X1*X2 + Y1*Y2 + Z1*Z2. This project contains 2 parts, the first in standard Assembly, the second doing the multiplication
					with hexadecimal encoding of the 32bit functions
				project two(Link to new page)
					This is a typescript for the second project of my CS2230 class. We were to send 8 hexadecimal characters to a C method and an Assembly method, and utilize masking
					to extract the specified byte in hexadecimal form from the input.
				project three(Link to new page)
					This is a typescript for the third project of my CS2230 class. There were 3 goals to be done in seperate methods:
						1. send input to CountBits which counts the number of 1s in the 8 character hexadecimal input
						2. a loop which finds the hexadecimal representation for the number just before the 'C' flag in NZVC is set
						3. a loop which finds the hexadecimal representation for the number just before the 'V' flag in NZVC is set
				project four(Link to new page)
					This is a typescript for the fourth project of my CS2230 class. The goal was to input grades, and output a scaled histogram of said grades on an 80x80 display
				project five(Link to new page)
					This is a typescript for the fourht project of my CS2230 class. The goal was to take a provided C program, compile it to Assembly, then remove as many lines as possible
					without losing effectiveness. The one with the least amount of lines received a snickers bar. 5 people of 60(including me) removed the full 14 possible lines.
